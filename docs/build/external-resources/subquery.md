# Indexing Data

Indexing provides a data structure that speeds up the retrieval of records, making it more effient and fast to access data.


# The importance of Indexing 

Data indexing plays a pivotal role in enhancing the efficiency, accessibility, and utility of blockchain networks.

Because blockchains record data in the form of sequential transactions, finding specific data fields for a specific type of transaction can become increasingly cumbersome and time-consuming.

This becomes even more challenging as the blockchain grows, making it crucial to be able to access data efficiently. By creating indexes, nodes in the network can quickly locate the information without having to scan the entire blockchain, thereby significantly improving query performance and user experience.

Indexing facilitates the analysis of blockchain data by structuring it into data that can be easily queried. 
Indexing also makes blockchain data more accessible and user-friendly, by enabling faster and more accurate data retrieval

# Using SubQuery to Index Data

CUDOS is supported on [SubQuery](https://search.brave.com/search?q=subquery&source=desktop), allowing developers to easily query all the data available on the CUDOS blockchain.

You can start indexing data by checking the [cudos-starter](https://github.com/subquery/cosmos-subql-starter/tree/main/Cudos/cudos-starter
) example.
