## Machine States

There are a few machine states to be aware of: 

- **Starting** - Your machine is starting up.
- **Running** - Your machine has started and is running.
- **Finished** - Your machine has run out of tokens and has finished running.
- **Failed** - Something went wrong and the machine failed to start.

## Machine Details

Click on a machineâ€™s ID to view more details about it. This will take you to the virtual machine's details page that contains information about its status, region, IP address, operating system distro and version, and specification.

## Managing Your Machines

You can perform actions on the VM such as **stopping** and **restarting** your machine on the machine details page. You can also destroy the VM completely and doing so will refund the unspent tokens outside of your current billing period.

Ensure you are certain you want to destroy your virtual machine before clicking the Destroy button. A virtual machine can be stopped and restarted.
