# Viewing Your Blockchain Identities

To view the identities associated with your CUDOS Intercloud account, click on the **Identities** option from the Menu. 

:::info

Identities on CUDOS Intercloud refer to the blockchain accounts added to your CUDOS Intercloud account. These are used for payments as well as VM management. 

:::

On this page you can see the current blockchain accounts you have added to your CUDOS Intercloud account.
All of them are shared within the account, and so VMs and payments can be managed by logging in with any of the accounts listed.

While only CUDOS identities can be added at the moment, other blockchain networks will be added soon.
