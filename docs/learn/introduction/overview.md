# Cudos

Cudos is a Delegated Proof-of-Stake, layer-1 blockchain with a vision for a decentralised computation accessible on-chain.

The design of the Cudos network separates **consensus** from **execution** to ensure secure, decentralised and permissionless access to high-performance computing at scale.

**Builders** on the network get access to:
- 🔧 High application performance
- 🏗 Developer-friendly toolkit
- 💱 Composable asset management

**Users** of the chain benefit from:
- 🔐 High cryptographic security
- 🔬 Public blockchain transparency
- 📬 Cross-chain interoperability
- 🌳 Carbon-neutral transactions

## Proof-of-Stake Consensus

A **Tendermint Core** engine manages consensus - powered by a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus model. The BFT model can tolerate less than one-third of the Byzantine validators reaching consensus. Considered to be a gold standard in Proof-of-Stake consensus, it is the most widely used consensus engine across the industry. The PoS algorithm reduces the Cosmos carbon footprint by more than 99% compared to Proof-of-Work blockchains like Bitcoin

## Why use the Cudos Network? 	

### Scalability and cross-chain interoperability

When economic activity becomes centralised on a single network, the result is bottlenecks of congestion and high transaction fees. 

Networks such as Ethereum have attempted to solve issues with scalability **'vertically'** with **Layer 2** solutions that leverage the underlying security of the **Layer 1** - Ethereum network. Transactions are executed off-chain on the Layer 2 with a 'proof of state' change sent back to the Layer 1. These proofs are then checked for fraud and verified before the underlying Layer 1 chain is updated. 

Increasingly, there is also a shift towards '**horizontal**' scaling solutions. These are enabled through the use of **multiple independent blockchains** or **sidechains** within a single ecosystem. Horizontal scaling spreads the **computation** of transactions in an ecosystem across many independent blockchains, with each chain having its own block producers and execution capacity.

Cudos addresses scalability **vertically and horizontally**. A lightning fast consensus mechanism (built on tendermint) enables thousands of transactions per second (tps) whilst an **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)** protocol enables **cross-chain interoperability** with an increasing number of Cosmos ecosystem members such as Osmosis. 

The **Cudos Bridge** brings further interoperability between the Cudos and **Ethereum** networks allowing for the transfer of tokens, assets, NFTs and data. 

The design of the Cudos network enables the following advantages:

- Instant finality
- Low latency
- Extremely low transaction costs
- Scalability
- Ability to deploy inter-chain smart contracts and build cross-chain applications.

### Developer Friendly

Cudos Network supports smart contract development that compiles to Web Assembly, using the [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com) module.

Rust developers can quickly set up a local and test network to build on.
