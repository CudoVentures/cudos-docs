This repository contains documentation for Cudos.

Cudos is a Layer 1 blockchain and Layer 2 community-governed compute network designed to ensure decentralised, permissionless access to high-performance computing at scale.

The Cudos Network is supported by the Cosmos SDK within the Cosmos Hub, in order to achieve high throughput, availability, and security.
